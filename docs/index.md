# Kazoo Install and Deploy Scripts

Our goal is to maintain a set of scripts with interactive and automated install methods.  These scripts will work on fresh minimal installs of CentOS 7.

## Maintained by [1pbx Solutions Inc.](https://1pbx.io/)

[1pbx](https://1pbx.io/) has taken the original scripts which were created for CentOS 6 systems and updated them to be used with CentOS 7.

### List of Scripts

Collection of scripts are within the scripts directory https://github.com/1pbx/kazoo-deploy/tree/master/scripts

#### Original Script Source

Scripts are based on the old community available scripts from [https://github.com/2600hz/community-scripts](https://github.com/2600hz/community-scripts)
