# Kazoo Install and Deploy Scripts

Our goal is to maintain a set of scripts with interactive and automated install methods.  These scripts will work on fresh minimal installs of CentOS 7.

## Original Script Source

Scripts are based on the old community available scripts from https://github.com/2600hz/community-scripts
